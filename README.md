# Multithreaded Java XML Server.

This project was made for school, where based on XML input we have to process it.
There is a generator that makes up to 800 connections and talks over TCP.

It is a multithreading and networking exercise. Current it can do the following:

- Create multithreaded network connections.
- Read the XML data over TCP and place it in a Queue.
